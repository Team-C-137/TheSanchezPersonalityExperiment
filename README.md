A Rick &amp; Morty Themed Personality Quiz

##Problem Domain:
In this ultra-consumerist reality that we currently find ourselves the only respite from the constant barrage to output more, create more, be more, is to dull our brains with mindless entertainment.  Our app is meant to bring you peace through comedy and give you a break from the monotony of the ultra-capitalistic society we live in.
