    { name: `INTP`, title: `The Thinker`, description: `An idiot that isn't so dumb that they need to base their opinions on any particular meaningless system of ideas, but based on their own intuition and perception of reality. If you have to spend time around another person, this is probably the one to be around.  They could be helpful at times even if just to block lasers from hitting the most important person, which is obviously me, Rick C-137 b************!!!!` },
    { name: `INFP`, title: `The Idealist`, description: `Ugh, Idealist, what could be worse, these "people" are self-absorbed with living life the way they perceive it should be. They purposely overlook the darkness of human nature in favor of seeing everyone in an unrealistically good light. People aren't good, they aren't bad, they're animals that follow their programming,idealists think they matter, but they don't. An idealist is someone who expects the best from people, not realizing that not everyone is willing to give up their time or money as willing as they are.` },
    { name: `INTJ`, title: `The Scientist`, description: `You call yourself a scientist? I guess you probably call a hole in the ground your a** too. A rarely brilliant person who dedicates huge amounts of time, thought and money to writing a research paper but is somehow unable to make this research paper turn into a usable product. I have maybe only ever met 3 other REAL scientists, everybody else is a hack, probability-wise, you are too.` },
    { name: `INFJ`, title: `The Protector`, description: `Someone who thinks they have the brawn to protect others but is too f****** stupid to realize you don't need muscles you need brains to protect others.  Or they've deluded themselves into thinking that they actually care about another person and devote their life to trying to keep that person from experiencing pain, i.e. LIFE.  Protecting people only makes them weak, dependent, and comfortable which deprives them of agency and freedom, this works for livestock but it's not for me.  Don't be like this a**hole.` },
    { name: `ISTP`, title: `The Mechanic`, description: `I like how big this type of person can think, and I can respect them following their own rules and not caring about what happens in the wake.  What I can not abide is when they interfere in what I'm trying to do.  I mean how many times do I have to explain who's number 1?!  It's me!!  I've hired a few interns in the past who remind me of this, but other than that who needs em.` },
    { name: `ISFP`, title: `The Artist`, description: `You've got to be f****** kidding me, Jerry isn't an artist? How does this equate to artist? Whoever wrote these "personality assessments" should be locked away for crimes against science. An artist is someone who is too lazy to be a scientist but still knows how to party!! I've been saying for years that science is sometimes more art than science. If these artists could get some damn motivation maybe a couple of them might be able to make something really useful.` },
    { name: `ISTJ`, title: `The Duty Fulfiller`, description: `Ooooh look at me I love my country, I care about power structures and governments staying as they are. If your one of these d-bags, you probably have an unhealthy fetish for tradition.  You know what I say about that, scientifically, traditions are an idiot thing.  Obsessive need to be in charge and have other people follow your "rules", I couldn't care less about your rules. ` },
    { name: `ISFJ`, title: `The Nurturer`, description: `UGH!! Probably the most annoying people in the world. They're always trying to do the "right" thing, as if there was such a thing as right and wrong. Nobody has a purpose in life but these people have even less than no purpose. They tend to just hinder genius because they can't understand how the world works. ` },
    { name: `ESFJ`, title: `The Caregiver`, description: `The Caregiver, huh.  Did someone let a 6th grader with a thesaurus name these categories?!  Based on the name alone these people are probably giant dopes.  Look at me, I care about other people and what they think about me.  What a f****** waste.  Get your head out of each other's a**** and do something that doesn't contribute to the downward trend of the genepool.` },
    { name: `ESTJ`, title: `The Guardian`, description: `These people are often found trying to run other's lives, as if they would know how to, usually they can't even run their own lives without constant reassurance from those around them.  Every couple thousand dimensions you'll run into someone of this disposition that actually has their s*** figured out. But they tend to live lives of mediocrity and die overcome by their adequatulence.` },
    { name: `ESFP`, title: `The Performer`, description: `Finally someone I can get along with. These people like to have a good time and really know how to squanch it up. If you happen to be genius enough to find someone like this you should go on an interdimensional bender with them. UURRPP BLECHHH` },
    { name: `ESTP`, title: `The Doer`, description: `Overall these people can be fairly cool but they can't focus for s***.  I can't believe I'm going to do this but I'm going to quote my idiot grandson. "Get your s*** together.  Get it all together. And put it in a backpack. All your s***. So it’s together. And if you gotta take it somewhere, take it somewhere, you know, take it to the s*** store and sell it… Or put it in a s*** museum, I don’t care what you do, you just gotta get it together. Get your s*** together!"` },
    { name: `ENTJ`, title: `The Executive`, description: `I have to admit this one isn't that bad except how much they love order and rules. It seems like a perfectly good waste of a life to be so attached to a single long lasting purpose. Why not chill out a bit and have some fun, wing it from time to time, think outside the Meeseeks box from time to time. ` },
    { name: `ENTP`, title: `The Visionary`, description: `Most, what is the word I'm looking for... oh yeah, humans, most humans would say this describes me, but most humans are f****** idiots who can't even figure out how to use a plumbus. I'm the only me there is, but I suppose if you had to soothe your ego and "figure out" which one of these dumb categories to put yourself into this one would probably be the least bad. ` },
    { name: `ENFJ`, title: `The Giver`, description: `Ooof. This guy. I just... Where do I even start? This "type" of "person" focusing so much on other people liking them, they can't stop to realize that nobody truly likes anyone, liking someone is just and function of familiarity over time. And spending time with someone just so they like you is a pretty s***** way to waste your life.` },
    { name: `ENFP`, title: `The Inspirer`, description: `You could almost like this "type" of person if only they didn't care so much about other's approval. If you spent more time creating instead of jacking around trying to "help" others you'd probably have a lot more interesting of a life. Do yourself a favor and quit trying to inspire others, you'll thank me later when you're rolling in those flurbos at Blips and Chitz dawg!!` }
